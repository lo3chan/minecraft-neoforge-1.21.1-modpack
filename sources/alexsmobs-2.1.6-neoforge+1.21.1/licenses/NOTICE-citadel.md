# Bundled Citadel code

This mod bundles a subset of **Citadel** by Alex the 666 / Alex Modguy.

- Upstream: https://github.com/Alex-the-666/Citadel
- Licence: **LGPL-3.0-only** (full text: `licenses/LGPL-3.0-only.txt`)
- Version the subset was taken from: Citadel **2.6.3** for Minecraft 1.20.1

Alex's Mobs has always required Citadel as a hard dependency. Citadel has no Forge build
above Minecraft 1.20.1, so Alex's Mobs Continued carries the parts it actually uses
(animation system, Tabula/AdvancedEntityModel rendering, entity data store, raycoms
pathfinding, spawn-biome config, book GUI, collision hooks) instead.

The bundled classes live under `com.github.alexthe666.alexsmobs.citadel` — **relocated** from
their original `com.github.alexthe666.citadel` package, so that installing the real Citadel
mod alongside this one cannot cause duplicate classes on the same classloader.

Modifications made to the bundled code:

- package relocated as described above;
- the Citadel mod main class replaced by a small shim (`citadel/Citadel.java`) that routes the
  two Citadel packets over Alex's Mobs' own network channel;
- features Alex's Mobs never used removed (patreon capes, shaders/post effects, tick-rate
  control, video/audio players, the Tetris easter egg, world-gen surface rules, guide book
  chrome);
- the five mixins Alex's Mobs relies on rewritten into `com.github.alexthe666.alexsmobs.mixin`.

Alex's Mobs itself is LGPL-3.0 (declared as "GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE" in upstream's
mod manifest), so the bundled Citadel code is under the same licence as the mod carrying it.
Sources for this mod remain public.
